The code snippet at the start of this problem set loads a subset of data in an object called `nlsy`.  This data set began with roughly 12,000 American teenagers in 1979 and has been following them for many years. The object `nlsy` contains a random sub-sample of 1000 respondents and has already been cleaned for use on this problem set (so you don’t have to worry about missing data or incorrectly classified responses). The variables of interest in this problem are: \n",

    "*   `male`: a binary variable for whether the individual identifies as male\n",

We highly recommend these two readings to learn more about this issue:\n",
